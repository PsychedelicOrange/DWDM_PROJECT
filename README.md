CHESS DATASET MINING
 
Abstract 
The game of chess has been a subject of research for decades, and data mining techniques can provide valuable insights into its complex gameplay patterns. In this project, we aim to analyse patterns in chess games using data mining techniques. We will use various data mining techniques, such as clustering and classification, to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in large datasets of chess games. We will explore features such as the number of moves played, the player's colour (Black or white), the type of chess being played(Standard, Blitz etc.), the players' ratings, and the game's outcome. Our analysis aims to provide insights into gameplay patterns, identify strategies and trends, and discover new insights into the game of chess. The project has the potential to provide valuable insights into chess gameplay, which can be useful for players, coaches, and researchers.

Algorithms
Feature Extraction:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of data by identifying the most important features that explain the majority of the variance in the data. PCA can be used to extract the most important features from large datasets of chess games.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) - LDA is a topic modelling technique that can extract topics from text data. In chess games, LDA can extract topics or themes from game annotations or comments, such as the types of strategies or tactics used in the game.


Classification:
Random Forest: The algorithm can classify chess games into win, loss, or draw based on their features. The random forest can handle high-dimensional data and estimate the feature importance, which can help identify the most significant features that contribute to winning or losing the game.
Naive Bayes: The algorithm can classify chess games based on their opening moves. The naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classifier that can estimate the probability of a game belonging to a certain opening based on the features of the opening moves played.
Logistic Regression: The logistic regression model can be trained using the training set. The model learns to predict the probability of a game outcome (win, loss, draw) based on the input features.
